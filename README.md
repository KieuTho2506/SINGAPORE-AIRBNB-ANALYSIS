# SINGAPORE-AIRBNB-ANALYSIS
The data is soured from the Inside Airbnb website: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ which hosts publicly available data from Airbnb site. The data set comprises of four main tables but I will use two tables below for this analysis project:

- Detailed listings data.

- Detailed reviews

Our target audience we toward to are: People, who want to be a prospective Airbnb host in Singapore.

Through my analysis, I will answer the big questions: "How to become a successful host?"

The key to become successful is : review_score_rating

=> In this article, I will compare the reviews between listings with high rating (review_socre 5.0) and listings with low rating(review_score <=2.0) to answer the question: "What factors affect the rating and how to get a high rating?"

Main structures:
- Using Wordcloud to find out factors appear a lot when customers review between listings with high and low ratings.
- Analyze the following 3 factors to see insights about how those factors affect the rating: location, amenities and host.
- Propose solutions to improve customer satisfaction.
